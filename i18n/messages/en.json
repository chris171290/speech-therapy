      "question": "What is Talk & Bloom?",
      "answer": "Talk & Bloom is a pediatric speech-language pathology practice established in Thornhill, Ontario. We provide speech, language, and social communication therapy. Services are provided in English and Spanish."
    },
    "question2": {
      "question": "When to see a speech and language therapist?",
      "answer": "If you’re concerned about your child’s communication skills at any age, it’s best to have a screening or an assessment completed by a speech and language therapist as soon as possible. Early identification and treatment lead to best outcomes."
    },
    "question3": {
      "question": "How do I choose a private speech and language therapist?",
      "answer": "In Ontario, Canada, all speech-language pathologists (SLP) must be registered with the College of Audiologists and Speech Language Pathologists of Ontario (CASLPO). You may visit the CASLPO website to find a qualified SLP, that practices in your city, and who speaks your language. It’ll also help you find the therapy that best matches your child’s needs. Additionally, you can use your favorite search engine or virtual assistant. Remember to type keywords specifically related to what you need help with (e.g., pronunciation, social skills, etc.)"
    },
    "question4": {
      "question": "Do I need to be referred by a doctor?",
      "answer": "No. A doctor’s referral is not needed to access private speech and language therapy. You may book a screening or an assessment directly. Some insurance companies require a doctor’s referral to pay for your private speech therapy. Please check with your individual provider."
    },
    "question5": {
      "question": "Is speech therapy covered by OHIP and by private insurance?",
      "answer": "Unfortunately, OHIP doesn’t cover private speech therapy. Many extended health care plans do. Please check with your insurance company to confirm their specific criteria to pay for your speech and language therapy. Speech therapy is also considered a tax-deductible medical expense. Please check how to claim eligible medical expenses on your tax return."
    },
    "question6": {
      "question": "What are your service fees?",
      "answer": "Our national Speech-Language &amp; Audiology organization (SAC) sets the standard rates. Talk &amp; Bloom fees fall under these standards."
